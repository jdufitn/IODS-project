## ABOUT THE Course

I heard about the course from an email send by **Prof. Kimmo**, 
himself, and decided to join. So thanks **Kimmo**.
I am so excited to learn about **all things Data Science**. 

## EXPECT TO LEARN

I have used **R** and **Rstudio** for about three years now.
However, I have not yet tried out **GitHub**. I thought
this would be a good chance and refresh my analytics skills.

## Link to my GitHub repository
Here is the link to my GitHub 
**[Josephine's GitHub](https://github.com/jdufitn/IODS-project)**.


## A curious question

As I am a regular R user, I guess things like

* Import and read data
* Data visualization
* Run linear models
* Explore data

```{r}
head(mtcars$disp) # few first
tail(mtcars$disp) # few last
```
Would be familiar. I was wondering if, during the course, we will also explore writing **R packages**.
